		Hi Wifey ❤️❤<br />

Hope you are doing well<br />

Happy Six-month Anniversary to the most amazing girl I have ever known in my life You will always be special in my heart. We live happily because we complete each other perfectly. People ask me why I always smile, how do I tell that I smile when I think about you, and I think about you always.

Cheers to beautiful and amazing days and wonderful moments ahead of us. I love you and wish you a nice anniversary. ❤️💥❤💥❤💥❤️<br />

Thanks and regards<br />
Your boy
